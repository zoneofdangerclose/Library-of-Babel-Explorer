Bacteria are often found living in aggregated multicellular communities
known as biofilms. biofilms are three-dimensional structures that confer distinct
physical and biological properties to the collective of cells living within them. We
used agent-based modeling to explore whether local cellular interactions were
sufficient to give rise to global structural features of biofilms. Specifically, we asked
whether chemorepulsion from a self-produced quorum-sensing molecule, autoinducer-2
(AI-2), was sufficient to recapitulate biofilm growth and cellular organization observed
for biofilms of Helicobacter pylori, a common bacterial resident of human stomachs.
To carry out this modeling, we modified an existing platform, Individual-based
Dynamics of Microbial Communities Simulator (iDynoMiCS), to incorporate three-
dimensional chemotaxis, planktonic cells that could join or leave the biofilm struc-
ture, and cellular production of AI-2. We simulated biofilm growth of previously
characterized H. pylori strains with various AI-2 production and sensing capacities.
Using biologically plausible parameters, we were able to recapitulate both the varia-
tion in biofilm mass and cellular distributions observed with these strains. Specifi-
cally, the strains that were competent to chemotax away from AI-2 produced smaller
and more heterogeneously spaced biofilms, whereas the AI-2 chemotaxis-defective
strains produced larger and more homogeneously spaced biofilms. The model also
provided new insights into the cellular demographics contributing to the biofilm
patterning of each strain. Our analysis supports the idea that cellular interactions at
small spatial and temporal scales are sufficient to give rise to larger-scale emergent
properties of biofilms.
