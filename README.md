# Library-of-Babel-Explorer
Fun data project for exploring API's, strings, and drawing order from chaos 

The filtering is agressive, the point is not to find ever word, but to find clusters of probable words to locate larger messages.

Total number of words found: 9

Longest sentence: ""

Most Coherent Paragraph: ""

Honorable Mentions:

The percent of words that pass filtering has a normal distribution. This is a truely random system so it would be expected to have a normal distribution
and that means we can easily perform some statistical analysis and find outliers. Maybe it is worth screening out any pages that aren't outliers.

From the first book, there does not appear to be a correlation between the number of words that pass filter and the number of words that ultimately have definitions. However, I also have not encountered a page with more than one word.
